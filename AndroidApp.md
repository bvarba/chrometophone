# Android Application #

After installing the extension in your desktop browser you have to install the Apk in your Android phone.

**Note that this application requires Android 2.2 ("Froyo") or later.**

Search the Android market for "chrometophone" and install it to your phone (you can scan the QR code below). Then just follow the steps in the wizard to enable it with the same account that you have used in your browser.
