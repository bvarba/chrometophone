Google Chrome to Phone Extension is a project consisting of a Chrome Extension, Android App, and supporting AppEngine server that enables users to send links from their Chrome desktop browser to their Android device using Android's Cloud to Device Messaging service.

Features:
  * Send links to browser
  * Google Maps links launch the Google Maps app.
  * YouTube links launch the YouTube app.
  * Selecting phone numbers in Web pages, launches the dialer with the number pre-populated.
  * Selected text populates the Android clipboard (long-press on text boxes to get paste option).
  * Right click on links and selections.

**Update (15th Sep 2010): Chrome to Phone 2.1 is now available on Chrome Extension Gallery and Android Market in multiple countries. If you had a pre-release version installed, please uninstall the old version first (otherwise you will get an error installing the new version).**

**Note: Android 2.2 required.** Chrome to Phone is powered by the Android Cloud to Device Messaging (C2DM) service, which requires Android 2.2 or later. Supports Chrome 6 and above.
